# nature_spotz_rest_api

A rest api for a nature service that will allow people to create
postings for spots in nature that they feel are worth visiting.

The api has been implemented with the django rest framework and I chose to use a
postgres database with postgis extensions because postgres is well-designed for
geospatial queries.

I plan to implement an android app and angular web service on top of this api.

Try out the api here:

Here is some of the planning/preliminary documentation:
